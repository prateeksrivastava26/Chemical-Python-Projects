# CRE 
This branch of CE deals with Chemical Reaction Engineering. 
Attempt will be to cover all the major topics and automate stuff like: 
Interpretation of Batch Reactor data
 - CVBR (integral method of analysis)
 - VVBR (Differential and integral method of analysis)
Design of ideal reactors
- Batch Reactors
- Ideal Flow reactors (MFR/PFR)
- Levenspiel Plot
- Size comparison of single flow reactors
Multiple reactor networks
- Series and parallel combo
Recycle and autocatalytic reactors
Multiple reactions

Question/concept credits: M.Subbu/D.K. Sandilya 's GATEway to Chemical Engineering.
